    "# 1. Network Characteristics [25 points]\n",
    "One of the goals of network analysis is to find mathematical models that characterize real-world\n",
    "networks and that can then be used to generate new networks with similar properties. In this\n",
    "problem, we will explore two famous models—Erdős-Rényi and Small World—and compare them\n",
    "to real-world data from an academic collaboration network. Note that in this problem all networks\n",
    "are undirected. You may use the starter code in hw1-q1-starter.py for this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Erdős-Rényi Random graph (G(n, m) random network): Generate a random instance of this\n",
    "model by using n = 5242 nodes and picking m = 14484 edges at random. Write code to\n",
    "construct instances of this model, i.e., do not call a SNAP function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Small-World Random Network: Generate an instance from this model as follows: begin with\n",
    "n = 5242 nodes arranged as a ring, i.e., imagine the nodes form a circle and each node is\n",
    "connected to its two direct neighbors (e.g., node 399 is connected to nodes 398 and 400),\n",
    "giving us 5242 edges. Next, connect each node to the neighbors of its neighbors (e.g., node\n",
    "399 is also connected to nodes 397 and 401). This gives us another 5242 edges. Finally,\n",
    "randomly select 4000 pairs of nodes not yet connected and add an edge between them. In\n",
    "total, this will make m = 5242 · 2 + 4000 = 14484 edges. Write code to construct instances of\n",
    "this model, i.e., do not call a SNAP function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Real-World Collaboration Network: Download this undirected network from http://snap.\n",
    "stanford.edu/data/ca-GrQc.txt.gz. Nodes in this network represent authors of research\n",
    "papers on the arXiv in the General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology section. There is\n",
    "an edge between two authors if they have co-authored at least one paper together. Note\n",
    "that some edges may appear twice in the data, once for each direction. Ignoring repeats and\n",
    "self-edges, there are 5242 nodes and 14484 edges. (Note: Repeats are automatically ignored\n",
